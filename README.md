# VMUG_2018
These are my 2018 VMUG presentations

"Auto deploy for he average Joe"

Is my June VMUGDK summer event presentation.
It's about what options you have for PXE booting and automating your ESXi installation, when you don't have the Enterprise Plus license.
The first part is on using Microsoft WDS for deploying ESXi.
The second part is on what else you can automate in your virtual environment
